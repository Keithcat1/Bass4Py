"""
Bass4Py provides access to all functionalities the BASS audio library from `un4seen.com <http://www.un4seen.com/>`_ has to offer, organized in a nice object-oriented interface.

This documentation will heavily cross-reference to the original BASS documentation to avoid duplicate documentation.
If there are any noticeable differences, this documentation will mention them. The BASS documentation will cover the basics though.

The main class is the :class:`Bass4Py.bass.BASS` class which should be consulted in order to get any project going.
