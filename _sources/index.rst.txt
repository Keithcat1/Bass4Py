Welcome to Bass4Py's documentation!
===================================

What is Bass4Py?
----------------

Bass4Py is a wrapper around the popular all-in-one BASS audio library from 
`un4seen.com <http://www.un4seen.com>`_. Although there were some wrappers for 
that library before, like 
`sound_lib <https://github.com/Accessiware/sound_lib>`_ or 
`pybass <https://pypi.org/project/pybass/>`_, all those projects are either 
inactive or incomplete or simply incompatible to Python 3. Also, those 
project's goal was to wrap all the different API calls into the Python 
namespace, without trying to provide a more pythonic interface to the entire API. 

Bass4Py aims to fill the gap by providing an entire object-oriented interface 
to the BASS API which feels more natural and logical than just calling a set of 
functions. It allows native pythonic interactions, like creating Streams 
directly from file-like objects and passing around native Python functions as 
callbacks where needed. Using Cython to develop its code, Bass4Py tries to 
minimize the wrapping overhead as much as possible to stay as flexible and 
fast as the original C-API. Full python 3 compatibility is guaranteed, 
including `MyPy <http://mypy-lang.org>`_ typings to ensure type safety.
